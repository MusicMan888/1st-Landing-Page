# 1st-Landing-Page
This is the second TOP Project - a landing page 

This project involves taking a design provided as a photo of a landing page (and some font sizes and colors) and recreating it using the skills taught up to this point and perhaps some that were not part of the lesson plans.

Each section has been a challenge in it's own way, I committed myself to not look and any solutions and to figure out each section myself. The first two sections were not too bad as most of the material was covered. The third section was very hard, as the text under the image placeholders was not covered in any of the lessons. However thanks to google, Stack overflow, mdn and experimentation I was able to reproduce the design fairly accurately.

One thing I learned as a result, was the relationship between the div boxes and the text (paragraph), how to encapsulate the box and the the text inside a box, inside the flex container. I thought there was some style that had to be applied to get the text to be a caption, but it was the top to bottom (normal flow) of the html that put the text below the box.

The fourth section "inspiring quote" was also difficult and had me wondering if I was completely wrong in my understanding of flex box, in the end I was able to duplicate the look of the section, however I'm not happy with the way the text spills out when the page width is reduced. I was able to get the page to use the roboto font but again not to my liking.

The fifth section "call to action" was slightly easier because I planned the boxes out first. The most difficult part was styling and positioning the button. I did notice that the proportions of the entire page seems slightly narrow due to the fact that I printed the photo provided as a guide. The instructions indicate it was not necessary to make it pixel perfect so I will keep this in mind for the next landing page I create.
